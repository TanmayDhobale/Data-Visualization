## Overview
This document provides a detailed explanation of the development process for creating a Data Visualization Dashboard. The dashboard is designed to visualize data retrieved from a JSON file hosted on GitHub and display various charts based on the dat



a.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create an interactive dashboard that dynamically generates charts based on the data provided in the JSON file. Users should be able to view different visualizations of the data for analysis and insights.

## Technologies Used
- React.js
- Chart.js
- GitHub

## Development Process

### Step 1: Data Retrieval
- The JSON data used for visualization is hosted on GitHub.
- Fetching the data is done using the `fetch()` API in React.

### Step 2: Dashboard Component
- Created a Dashboard component in React to serve as the main interface for displaying visualizations.
- Utilized useState and useEffect hooks for managing state and side effects.

### Step 3: Chart Component
- Developed a Chart component using Chart.js library to create various types of charts (e.g., bar chart, line chart).
- Implemented useRef hook to create chart references dynamically.
- Integrated the Chart component into the Dashboard for rendering.

### Step 4: Styling
- Added CSS styles to enhance the visual appearance of the dashboard and charts.
- Applied responsive design principles to ensure compatibility across different devices.

## Error Handling
- Handled errors related to data fetching, such as 404 errors or syntax errors in JSON data.
- Implemented error messages to provide feedback to users in case of data retrieval failures.

## Challenges Faced
- Parsing JSON data: Addressed unexpected non-whitespace characters in JSON data by validating and formatting the data appropriately.
- Chart rendering: Ensured proper initialization and destruction of chart instances to prevent memory leaks and errors.
